<u><h1 class="title"> Lionel Andr√©s Messi</h1></u>

<!--When I first began my tribute page I was really lost on how I wanted to place my links to other webpages. It did not work at first and could not figure out how to get my link to work. I had the link in the html and my hover would work but when I clicked the image or the name it did not work. So, I went back into the lessons and my notes to see what I was missing and ultimately it was a small mistake of not putting in the target="_blank". After figuring this out I got my other links to work. I placed my links in the beginning of the tribute so if someone doesn't know who Messi is they can click it right away. Also I put the video in the beginning so it will catch my readers attention of Messi's goals. -->

<!--I placed this GIF at the end as a closer for the tribute page. I also specifically chose a GIF that went well as a closing. As you can see he is smiling and pointing fingers like it is pointing towards the reader. So I thought that him doing this action would kind of symbolize making the reader smile as they finished the reading. -->

<!--When figuring out how I wanted to layout and organize my tribute page it was difficult because I didn't know if I wanted everything to the left like an essay but I went back to my GIF essay and remembered how during the peer review everyone said the centered look worked really well so I thought why not do it again. I think it works really well on the tribute as well because it makes everything easy to read and looked more organized. -->
